# Advent of Code 2017

### What is this?
Advent of Code is a series of christmas themed programming puzzles by Eric Wastl.

This repository contains the solutions for [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017) that I've come up with.


### How to run
Solutions are written with C# and .NET core which means you'll need .NET core in order to run them. Please refer to Microsofts tutorial on how to create a Hello World app in 10 minutes for instructions.

- [.NET Core downloads](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

I strongly encourage you to check out [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2017) for yourself and give it a go!

***- Merry christmas, Christoffer***
